WIP personal site.

## Goals:

- No external dependancies, `devDependancies` are ok.
- No consideration for any browsers other than Chrome and modern mobile phones
- No transpiling, minification is ok.
- Extreme use of custom elements as opposed to a framework.
- `index.html` acts as the entire site map/content holder.
- CSS always preferred over JS when possible.
- No `z-index`.
- No reset/normalized CSS.
- No overriding CSS.
- Host site from github.com.

## To run site:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
